# Food Court Fighter 

An interactive web experience where players explore a retro-themed Chinese food court and "battle" through dishes inspired by real regional cuisines and traditional concepts like 寒气 (cold energy) and 火气 (hot energy).

## About the Game

In **Chinese Food Court Fighter**, you:
- Navigate through stylized food stalls representing **Sichuan**, **Zhejiang**, **Heilongjiang**, and **Xinjiang** cuisines.
- Interact with each region’s unique food offerings and cultural backstory.
- Learn how **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)** influences food choices — are you fighting 火气 with cool seafood, or warming up with lamb skewers?

## Key Features

- **Interactive Food Court** layout with animated player movement.
- **Dynamic Stall Interfaces** based on real flavor profiles and cultural aesthetics.
- **Food-based Fighter System**: Choose dishes that match your qi balance (寒/热).
- **Educational Blurbs** that connect cuisine to geography, history, and wellness philosophy.
- Retro pixel-style UI inspired by vintage food signage and 80s video games.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS  
- **Game Engine**: HTML5 Canvas or CSS positioning  
- **Media**: Custom illustrations, audio snippets, and hover animations  
- **Future Plans**: Integrate mini-games per stall (e.g., noodle pulling, spice level match)

## Educational Goals

This project aims to bridge cultural storytelling with fun interactivity. It reflects how regional Chinese cuisines are deeply tied to climate, health beliefs, and local histories — not just taste.
